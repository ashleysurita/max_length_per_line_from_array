# max_length_per_line_from_array

### Problem:
```
Given an array of words and a max length per line, return an array of strings 
where each string represents a fully justified line. 

A fully justified line means that the first letter and last letter in the line 
should be a letter and not a space, and extra spaces are distributed as evenly as 
possible.

Examples
["the", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"], k = 16

returns
["the  quick brown", // (2 spaces, 1 space)
"fox  jumps  over", // (2 spaces, 2 spaces)
"the   lazy   dog"]  // (3 spaces, 3 spaces)
```
